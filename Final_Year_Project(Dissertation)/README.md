This folder contain the two work files from my final year project(Dissertation): Develop an intelligent algorithm to monitor stress through physiological signal. The two seperate files are working with different purposes.

Process.ipynb will be applied with data handling purposes, including filtering and resampling the raw data from the source file, as well as feature extraction purposes of finding meaningful information. Dataset with meaningful information will be formed and produced after the execution of the file.

Learning.ipynb will apply the datasets produced from Processs.ipynb and carry out classification on data by the support of various learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perception, Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory.
